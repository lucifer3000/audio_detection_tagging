# Audio Event Detection and Tagging
Sound event detection is the task of identifying
different sound events present in audio along with their respective
start and stop times. In this project, we have implemented five
methods namely, Linear regression, CNN, RNN, GMM, and a
DSP-based method to detect speech and music events in audio
files.
